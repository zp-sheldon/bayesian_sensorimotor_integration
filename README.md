# BayesianSensorimotorIntegration
This was my final project for my Probabilistic Models of Perception and Cognition course at Penn (taught by Dr. Alan Stocker). 

For this project, I replicated the model and results from Kording &amp; Wolpert's 2004 Nature paper, Bayesian Integration in Sensorimotor Learning. The study explored a Bayesian probabilistic approach to sensorimotor integration, specifically in a visual estimation task. I implemented the core model from the paper, replicating their results that showed how a Bayesian framework is consistent with the way in which individuals integrate an experimentally controlled prior distribution with their level of sensory uncertainty.
