# BayesianSensorimotorIntegration
This was my final project for my Probabilistic Models of Perception and Cognition course at Penn (taught by Dr. Alan Stocker). For this project, I replicated the model and results from Kording &amp; Wolpert's 2004 Nature paper, Bayesian Integration in Sensorimotor Learning.
